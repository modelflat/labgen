# LabGen - tool for generating laboratory work reports

**WARNING 1:** This project is only pre-alpha and might stay in this state forever.

**WARNING 2:** This project is based on python module _re_ in educational purposes only. Yes, I know about _regex_ and _pyparsing_, and probably will move this project on _pyparsing_ in the indefinite future, but for now it remains as is

Docs are available in [project's wiki](https://github.com/modelflat/labgen/wiki)
